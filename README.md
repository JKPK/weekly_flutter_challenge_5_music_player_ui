# weekly_flutter_challenge_5_music_player_ui

## Challenge summary:
This challenge is about recreating Kazi Mohammed Erfan's [Music Player UI design](https://www.uplabs.com/posts/free-music-player-ui). The goal is to recreate the design and interactions as closely as possible. The application should be functional by the end of the challenge.



## Things that I have learned during the development of this challenge app:
1. [Audioplayers](https://pub.dev/packages/audioplayers) package.
2. [Duration](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-core/Duration-class.html) class.
